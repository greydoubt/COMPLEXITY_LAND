# The Haunted Factory

'''In a mysterious haunted factory, there is a machine known as the "Specterizer." This machine takes in lumps of Ouranian coal and transforms them into ghosts. However, the factory owner wants to ensure that the ghosts are produced in a specific order based on their spectral properties.

Each lump of Ouranian coal has a unique spectral signature, represented by a sequence of spectral digits. The factory owner has provided a list of desired ghost spectral sequences that need to be produced by the Specterizer. However, the Specterizer has certain limitations and can only process a limited number of coal lumps at a time.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to feed the coal lumps into the Specterizer in a specific sequence, such that the resulting ghosts match the desired spectral sequences provided by the factory owner.

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach that considers all possible combinations of coal lumps and their spectral sequences. We will build a table that tracks the state of the Specterizer at each step, storing whether it is possible to generate the desired spectral sequence by considering different combinations of coal lumps.'''

# Example usage
ouranian_coal = ["11", "01", "10", "00", "11"]
desired_sequences = ["10", "00", "11"]

result = solve_haunted_factory(ouranian_coal, desired_sequences)
print(result)


'''In this code, the ouranian_coal represents the list of coal lumps with their respective spectral signatures. The desired_sequences represents the list of desired spectral sequences that need to be produced by the Specterizer.

The solve_haunted_factory() function applies dynamic programming to determine whether it is possible to generate the desired spectral sequences by considering different combinations of coal lumps. It iterates through the sequences and coal lumps, checking if the current coal lump matches the desired spectral digit. If there is a match, it updates the dynamic programming table accordingly. It also considers the possibility of using previous coal lumps to generate the current sequence.

After the dynamic programming iteration, the function checks if any of the entries in the last row of the table are True, indicating that it is possible to generate the desired spectral sequences using the available coal lumps.

The code then prints the result indicating whether it is possible or not to generate the desired spectral sequences.'''
