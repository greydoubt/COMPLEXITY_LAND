#Scarlet Witch's Reality Manipulation

'''The Scarlet Witch possesses the extraordinary ability to manipulate reality, altering the fabric of space and time. She can create and reshape entire universes, but her powers are not without limitations. To maintain control over her reality-altering abilities, she must carefully manage her available resources.

The goal is to determine if the Scarlet Witch can achieve a desired reality state within the bounds of her resource limitations, while adhering to certain rules.

The Scarlet Witch has a limited pool of energy and a limited number of reality-altering actions she can take. Each action consumes a specific amount of energy, and she must manage her energy reserves to ensure she can complete her desired reality state. Additionally, each reality-altering action has certain dependencies or prerequisites that must be satisfied before it can be performed.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible for the Scarlet Witch to achieve her desired reality state given her resource limitations and the dependencies of her reality-altering actions.

This problem falls into the complexity class of PSPACE, as the solution requires polynomial space to store and process the dependencies and resource limitations of the Scarlet Witch's reality manipulation.'''

'''In this code, the check_reality_state() function takes the energy_limit, action_limit, and desired_state as input. It defines a recursive explore_reality_state() function that explores all possible reality states. It checks if the current state matches the desired state and if the energy and action limits are not exceeded. It iterates through the available reality-altering actions and checks if each action is a valid option based on the current state. If a valid action is found, it performs the action and recursively explores the resulting state. If a valid path leads to the desired state within the energy and action limits, the function returns True.
            
By utilizing a recursive exploration of reality states, this code demonstrates how the Scarlet Witch's Reality Manipulation problem falls into the PSPACE complexity class. The solution space grows exponentially with the number of available reality-altering actions and the number of actions allowed, but the space complexity remains polynomial.
            
This can be tuned by customising the energy_limit, action_limit, and desired_state parameters, as well as the reality_altering_actions list, to create your own whimsical scenarios with the Scarlet Witch's reality manipulation. Modify the preconditions, energy costs, and perform actions to explore different possibilities and observe how the code determines the achievability of the desired reality state.'''
